# 3-Bit Paper Computer Simulator #
Webpage simulator for a 3-bit paper compuer

This is a 3-bit paper computer I designed for learning about algorithms. It's 3 bits because it still maintains some usefulness while only having 8 addressable memory locations. I wanted it to all fit an a single page. The computer is given as a pdf in the files.

A few example programs are given in the progs.txt file.
